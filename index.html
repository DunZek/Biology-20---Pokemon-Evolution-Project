                        <h2>The characteristics of Pikachu</h2>
                        <P>To discuss the characteristics of the pikachu, we must consider its predecessor, the pichu. Other than pikachu and pichu, raichu is also a part of the evolutionary line of pikachu. Raichu, the successor of pikachu, will not be discussed.</P>

                        <h3>Pichu</h3>
                        <img src="/dist/img/pichu2.png" alt="">
                        <p>The ground dwelling and tiny mouse pokemon is pichu. Specimens of pichus can be found living in groups primarily in forested and arid regions.</p>
                        <p>Groups of pichus and electric-type pokemons are often sighted thriving in urban sects. Densely electric man-made infrastructures such as power generation facilities, power towers and modern buildings are areas that host electric-type pokemon wildlife. The abundance of electricity in the area attracts these types of pokemon.</p>
                        <p>Pichus in particular are able to recharge its electric storage nearby power towers, despite humid or clear weather conditions. Their tail and pink cheek pouches enable them to discharge electricity, although ineptly. If startled or subjected to shock, a pichu is able to discharge 50 volts and cause electrocution damage or paralysis if 30 mA is conducted through human or pokemon bodily parts and tissues.</p>
                        <p>Pichus are known for their playful and mischievous behaviour. Pichus touch tails with other pichus when interacting, usually creating a shower of sparks that can make them cry. They are shy towards human beings and interactions can lead to electrocution. Usually when discharging, a pichu is able to shock itself. Although considered quadruped, a pichu is able to walk easily on its hind legs.</p>

                        <h3>Pikachu</h3>
                        <img src="/dist/img/pikachu2.png" alt="">
                        <p>Pikachu, the mouse pokemon, is the successor of pichu. Like pichus, pikachus are social creatures that live in groups around forested and arid regions.</p>
                        <p>A pikachu is able to adeptly discharge electricity through its red electrical sacs and tail. Pikachus communicate amongst themselves using squeaks, tail gestures, and electricity by sending and receiving messages. Other than communcation, pikachus have been known to use electricity to roast food, invigorate electric-type pokemons and avoid particular complications.</p>
                        <p>A pikachu's tail acts like a grounding rod, which enables the pikachu to recharge itself by redirecting lightning strikes. Like pichu, pikachu can stand and walk on its hind legs.</p>

                        <h2>The genetic adaptations</h2>
                        <p>Basically, the genetic mutations of the pikachu pokemon are characteristics the pichu pokemon doesn't possess. Compared to the pichu, the pikachu pokemon is a more robust build, which is capable of thriving in environments above ground.</p>
                        <p>Availability of resources such as food and space could have allowed the growth of the pikachu. Particularly, as potent sources of electricity becomes accessible through man-made infrastructures, electric-type pokemons of all sorts compete less and are able to grow in the abundance of energy.</p>
                        <p>Currently, the pikachu's most prominent and frequent genetic mutations are:</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3> Electricity utilization: Thunder-bolt
                        </h3>

                        <p>To access and utilize the abundance of electric energy in places above ground (in places such us arid environments and areas near man-made infrastructure for example), the pikachu pokemon uses its ground-rod-like tail and pair of electric cheek sacks. Through these organs, a pikachu is capable of manipulating the electric energy it has stored, or around it in order to accomplish particular tasks.</p>
                        <p>Natural selection calls for capable specimens adept at controlling this particular force of nature. In this part of the pichu's evolutionary timeline, we can experience organisms capable of discharging 100,000 volts in seconds. </p>

                        <h3>Leaner body = increased ground mobility: Quick-attack</h3>
                        <video controls>

                        <p>The pikachu's comparatively robust build allows a pikachu to nimbly maneuver on the forest floors and in grassy foliage. As the dry environments above ground become more hospitable for the pichu, competitive selective pressure between populations naturally starts to take effect.</p>
                        <p>As a result, the descendants of pichu are more built to be maneuverable. Contrasting to the pichu's petite frame, the pikachu possesses a leaner torso and leaner limbs to allow faster legwork.</p>

                        <p>The pikachu pokemon is capable of using its ground-rod-like tail to inflict physical damage.</p>
                        <p>Selective pressures imposed on the descendants of the pichu lead to the development of the very tough tail of the pikachu. Other than being capable of imparting physical force onto an object, this very tough tail is capable of redirecting lightning strikes.</p>
                        <p>Specimens with more versatile tails were more capable at interacting with their environment and harnessing the electrical forces of their environment, thus were more fit for their environment and flourished.</p>

                    <section id="discussion">
                        <h2>Discussion</h2>
                        <p>Let's start with the disadvantages of Pikachu's evolution:</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Enlarged tail</h3>
                        <p>The pikachu's bigger tail enlarges its silhouette, exposing it in its environment. Although these bigger tails were stronger and more effective at helping a pikachu control its environment, its means of escape had been  sacrificed. Although the pikachu had traded its means of escape, it had done so to be able to fight off aggressors of all shapes and sizes in order to survive.</p>
                        <p>When pikachus with larger tails became more successful than other pikachus however, in the end these same pikachus would have been able to mate, causing the next descendants to possess potentially larger tails.</p>
                        <h3>Enlarged body</h3>
                        <p>The pikachu's body, although is leaner and sturdier than the pichu's, is easier to hit because it is larger and bulkier. The pichu is more capable than pikachu at narrowly missing attacks and particular forceful impacts because of its smaller frame. As a result of this, pikachus are likely easier to take damage  from other pokemons and or humans.</p>
                        <p>In the end, larger pikachus more capable of shrugging off hits were able to survive better than those that are easily more injured or scathed. As these land-dwelling pokemons continue to feed off of the abundance of resources, they would continue to grow to sizes no pichu has grown to.</p>
                        <p>As the bulkier pikachus survive and thus were able to mate, larger offsprings would continue to be produced.</p>
                        <h3>Lack of escape</h3>
                        <p>As a result of the larger volume of space, the pikachu's body would make retreating underground a harder task compared to the pichu's body. It is incredibly important for mobile organisms to possess a means of escape because of the potential dangers that come with every environment.</p>
                        <p>As a result, the pikachu had to adapt to completely living on the ground as oppose to under it like the pichu. When the pikachu could no longer benefit from underground spaces, it had to rapidly flee from danger by means of terrestrial locomotion (running or galloping in other words).</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Advantages of Pikachu's evolution:</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Tougher tail</h3>
                        <p>The pikachu's ground-rod-like tail enables a pikachu to impart tremendous forces upon the receiving end. Aggressors hit with this tail will be forced to back off from the pikachu, letting the pikachu a way to escape.</p>
                        <h3>Very conductive tail</h3>
                        <p>The tail is capable of controlling the electrical forces around a pikachu's environment. Because of the conductive nature of the tail, a pikachu is capable of transmitting and receiving electricity from other electric-type pokemons, recharge from sources and redirect current.</p>
                        <h3>Potent electric sacs</h3>
                        <p>The pair of electrical sacs on pikachu's cheeks lets it harness the full potential of electricity. The electricity stored in these sacs enable Pikachu to communicate over distances, roast food and fend off predators and aggressors much larger than itself.</p>
                        <h3>Sturdier body</h3>
                        <p>Compared to pichu, pikachu's sturdier body lets him take more hits and attacks. If a pikachu is able to leave a dangerous encounter as unscathed as possible, it will be able to mate and produce offspring.</p>
                        <h3>Taller frame</h3>
                        <p>Pikachu's taller frame enables it to survey its surroundings better, allowing pikachu to be on the look out for danger and increasing pikachu's survival rate.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Without a doubt, pikachus are more versatile organisms compared to the pichus. The pikachu's ground-rod-like tail and red electric cheek sacs enables a pikachu to better manipulate the forces of electricity, and thus the environment around itself.</p>
                        <p>However, as the descendants of pichu are built to thrive above the ground, those descendants would have a hard time returning back in the earth at an impending disaster's notice.</p>
                        <p>Although the pikachu is a successful organism and pokemon overall, the pikachu still needs to pay the price for the tools that gave it its success.</p>
